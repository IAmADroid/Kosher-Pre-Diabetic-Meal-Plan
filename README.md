# Kosher-Pre-Diabetic-Meal-Plan
Schedules and Recipes for the people who hate dieting but are curious about cooking

If you haven't guessed, this project is still in it's infancy, and is maintained by someone who is by no means a reputable source on proper nutrition. Please feel free to extend this project, submit pull requests, issues, etc. At the moment of writing, I can barely cook anything, I encourage you to give feedback.

I decided I needed to make this repository because I didn't make a proper lunch today, and after raiding the fridge and eating some ice-cream, my vision went blurry ([A spike in blood sugar can make the lens of your eyes swell](https://www.verywellhealth.com/blurry-vision-after-eating-5118069#:~:text=High%20Blood%20Sugar%20Can%20Cause%20Blurry%20Vision&text=Sudden%20high%20blood%20sugar%20following,%2C%20the%20lens%2C%20to%20swell.)) Anyways, it's hella annoying to work on my computer with all the text at %200. So I think it's time to make this stop.

I didn't choose to make this kosher prediabetic meal plan, I would really like to enjoy normal food, but I'm at risk of diabetes from my family history, and my family is jewish, so I'd rather not become the pariah of the family just because I couldn't be bothered to avoid bacon and shellfish. If you were expecting one of those Hippie Homeopathic essential oils stuff you can leave now; You need to be able to prove stuff with peer-reviewed experiment to convince me.
